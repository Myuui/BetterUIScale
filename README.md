# Advanced UI Scaling

This mod is an updated fork of [BetterUIScale](https://github.com/YeahImRose/BetterUIScale)

This mod aims to improve on Minecraft's implementation of GUI scaling by adding 15 logarithmic GUI scales as opposed to the normal, preset 3.

Also, has built-in compatibility with Sodium's reworked video settings screen!
